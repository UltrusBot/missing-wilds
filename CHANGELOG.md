This is the full release of the v1.2.0 update.

## Changes since last beta:
- Forge version re-enabled, will be neoforge in future versions.
- Fixed quilt crash when tablesaws is missing.
- Added Aether and Biomes O' Plenty Compat

## Major v1.2.0 features:
- Forget me nots are renewable now, due to the fact that you can grow them via bonemeal in biomes in the `#missingwilds:birch` tag.
- That tag also controls where forget me nots and extra grass spawns.
- Birch trees grown from saplings are now also larger, like the ones from the biome now.
- Turkish Translation from Hexasan, Thank you!
- Fireflies have been added, which spawn in the `#missingwilds:firefly_spawn_biomes` tag
- Added compat for quite a few mods, too many to list here, check previous beta changelogs for a full list.
- Jars have been added, which can store fireflies for a nice decorative light source, and can store food too.
- You can add your own fallen logs through json files, which will have the assets automatically generated.
  - This process will be explained better in a wiki I'm currently creating for this mod.
