    - You can also store fireflies in them, by using a firefly bottle on the jar block, or by using the jar item on a firefly swarm to capture it.
    - There are regular glass jars, tinted glass jars, and stained glass jars.
    - Clicking the jar with an empty hand will toggle the cover.
- Firefly Jars
    - When you collect fireflies in a jar, the light level of the jar increases.
    - Using a firefly bottle increases the light level by 1, while collecting a whole swarm in a jar increases it by 3.
    - You can use dye on the jar to change the color of the fireflies, and the colors are combined, like leather armor.
    - You can rename the firefly jar, certain names will have special firefly colors (Such as "pride" for pride flag colors)
    - A jar with a open cover spawns firefly particle above the jar, and a closed cover spawns the particles inside the jar.
      - Note: Stained glass hides particles unless your in fabulous graphics mode, and this applies to the stained glass jars.
