Adding what was missing from the wild update into the game!


<img src="https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/Missing_Wilds/BH_MW_banner1.webp" alt="Description"/>

This mod runs on fabric and quilt, and forge.


Missing Wilds adds the features scrapped / removed from the wild update. These features include:
- Better Birch Biomes, with taller trees decorated with polypores and fallen logs scattered throughout.
- Fallen Logs, which are hollow and can be crawled through, and can be made out of any logs.
- Polypore Mushrooms, which grow on the sides of the birch trees. They can even be cooked and eaten.
- Forget Me Not flowers which grow in patches throughout the birch forest.
- Tall Sweetspire flowers that are found throughout the birch forest.
- Fireflies, which can be collected in jars for beautiful lighting and ambience.
- Jars which can store fireflies, food, and even more in future updates.
